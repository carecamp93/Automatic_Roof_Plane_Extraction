# **Automatic extraction of Building Roofs Planes in urban environments for 3D modelling using Remote Sensing data**

 This repository contains all the  scripts used in the development of the paper: "Automatic extraction of Building Roofs Planes in urban envi-ronments for 3D modelling using Remote Sensing data" ( Remote Sensing MDPI, 2023), and the MSc. thesis: "AUTOMATIC BUILDING ROOF PLANE STRUCTURE EXTRACTION FROM REMOTE SENSING DATA FOR LOD2 3D CITY MODELLING" (ITC-UT, 2023).

 The presented work were developed on the top of the work developed by Chen, 2022 on the paper: HEAT: Holistic Edge Attention Transformer for Structured Reconstruction.
